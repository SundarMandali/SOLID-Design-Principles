SOLID Design Principles in Java

Overview:
This repository demonstrates the SOLID Design Principles in Java. Each principle is explained with clear examples, including both bad and good scenarios, to help you understand their real-world application.

SOLID Principles:
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have only one reason to change. It should have a single responsibility or function.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Derived classes should be able to replace their base classes without affecting the functionality of the program.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead, interfaces should be split into smaller, more specific ones.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Instead, both should depend on abstractions.

Repository Structure:
Each SOLID principle is implemented in its respective directory, containing:

==>Bad Example: Demonstrates a violation of the principle.

==>Good Example: Shows the correct way to follow the principle.
